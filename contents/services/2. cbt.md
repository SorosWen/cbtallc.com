 Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the therapy of empowerment. It helps people change the way they think, feel and act through collaboration between a skilled therapist and a motivated patient.

Thoughts shape who we are and what we see around us. Our thoughts color all of our experiences and relationships. Some people may see their experience in black and white, good or bad. The therapists at CBTA try to help our patients develop a broader palette from which to paint their world.
