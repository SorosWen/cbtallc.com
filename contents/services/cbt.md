 Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a therapy of empowerment. It helps people change the way they think, feel and act through collaboration between a skilled therapist and a motivated patient.

Thoughts shape who we are and what we see around us. Our thoughts color all of our experiences and relationships. Some people may paint their experience in black and white, good or bad. Dr. Vermilyea helps people develop a broader palette from which to paint their world.

People are genetically programmed for everything from the color of their skin, the gender they are attracted to, and the color of their hair and eyes. That said, behaviors like thoughts are primarily learned. Reflexes are unlearned behaviors such as breathing, heart beating, and eye blinking. Human beings try to modify behaviors to be what they would like them to be or what makes them most comfortable.
