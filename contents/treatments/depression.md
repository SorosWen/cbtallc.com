Depression presents itself in different ways. There are gradations and variations in the types of depression people experience. At one end is dysthymia, which usually has fewer symptoms than other forms of depression, but can still cause just as much suffering. Major depression is more severe and may come once or recur many times during a person's life. Manic episodes are times when a person feels the opposite of depressed - irrationally high, with excess energy and a feeling that they are “on top of the world”. This can alternate with depressive episodes. When this happens, we say there is a case of bipolar disorder. In adolescents, anger, acting out and truancy may sometimes be the primary symptoms.

The depressed person hates feeling bad, so much so that they sometimes hate themselves for feeling this way. THey feel that other people all seem to be enjoying life but they are not. In fact, depression can paralize people to just laying in bed for feeling so poorly. They do not have the motivation to move as everything feels hopeless. The activities they used to do are no longer enjoyable.Depression can lead to pains in the body, olfactory hallucinations, hearing things, impairments of memory, concentration, sleep, and thoughts of suicide. Depression is treatable with Cognitive Behavior Therapy and/or  in combination with medications.
