Generalized anxiety is constant worry or discomfort. People with generalized anxiety usually end up feeling worn out, tense, irritable, restless, and have trouble sleeping. The worry is not usually limited to one thing, but is more pervasive and includes many things large and small.

Generalized anxiety can be treated effectively with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy where the patients learn to relax and control their thoughts. In addition to one-on-one session in the office, patients are usually assigned homework to work on from the comfort of home. We understand that changing the way that you feel and think is not an overnight task, and we are here to offer the support you need to accomplish this goal.
