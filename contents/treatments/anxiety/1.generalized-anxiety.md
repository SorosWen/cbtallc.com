Generalized anxiety is by definition what it sounds like. Generalized Anxiety symptoms include excessive anxiety and worry that feels like it doesn’t stop. People can end up feeling worn out, irritable, tense, restless, or have trouble sleeping. The worry isn’t about a specific type of anxiety or fear, like worrying about a plane flight, but is more pervasive.

Generalized anxiety can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy. The goal is to learn how to relax and control your thoughts. There is always work to do in your therapy and then homework to do when you are not in the office. Changing the way that you think is not an overnight task, but it is manageable with the right help.
