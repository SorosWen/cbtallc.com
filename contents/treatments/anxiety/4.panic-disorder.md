Panic attacks are bouts of extreme anxiety or fear that lead the person to think that they may be having a heart attack, losing control or going crazy. Sometimes, the panic attacks happen by chance in the same place several times, which could cause the person to start associating the location with the attacks. Avoidance happens when the person stays away from the place to prevent panic attacks. More extreme avoidance is called Agoraphobia.

We use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and exposure exercises which have been proven to be effective in treating Panic disorder and Agoraphobia.
