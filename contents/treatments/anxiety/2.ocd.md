Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is associated with worries about bad things that could happen. This causes so much anxiety that the person with these thoughts tries to make the anxiety go away or prevent the dreaded event by repeatedly checking things or performing routines and behaviors.

The thought is called the obsession. Examples of obsessions are thoughts of dirty things or things not in the right order. What the person does to make it the anxiety go away or to prevent the dreaded outcome is usually referred to as the compulsion. Examples of compulsions include excessive cleaning, counting, washing or repeating things.

There are also other types of obsessions including but not limited to thoughts about harming oneself and loved ones, performing sexual acts or otherwise tabooed thoughts.

Sometimes the OCD can be so persistent as to prevent normal daily activities and cause distress. Many OCD patients can also feel isolated, depressed and even suicidal.
