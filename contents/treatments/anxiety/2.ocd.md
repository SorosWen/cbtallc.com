Many common fears could lead to anxiety. Some people fear contaminants such as dirt, others fear their own thoughts which could contain unsettling images.

Anxiety is is a normal trap we as human beings fall into. But OCD is excessive and irrational. For example, excessive hand washing is meant to reduce anxiety, and works to reduce anxiety in the short run, but over time the rituals will not work as well. When this happens more, or different, rituals (thoughts or actions) will be needed to reduce the anxiety.

Sometimes the OCD has been so persistent the person may have expanded their compulsions to the point where doing anything can be difficult. With a fear that people may not understand, many people with OCD can feel very isolated, even depressed and sometimes suicidal.
