People fear many things that cause anxiety. Some people fear contaminants such as dirt, others fear their thoughts which can be very disturbing and consist of unsettling images.

This is a normal trap human beings fall into. For example, excessive hand washing is meant to reduce anxiety. But will it prevent that feared anxiety in the long run? It may work in the short run, but soon you will find that this is unsatisfactory. Then more, or different, rituals (thoughts or actions) will be needed to reduce the anxiety.

Sometimes the OCD has been so persistent the person may have expanded their compulsions to the point where doing anything can be difficult. With a fear that people may not understand, many people with OCD can feel very isolated, even depressed and sometimes suicidal.
