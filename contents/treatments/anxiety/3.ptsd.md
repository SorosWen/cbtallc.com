Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a series of intrusive recollections of a traumatic event that was experienced either directly or observed. Many people who observe or have a traumatic event happen will experience some symptoms. These often include intrusive recollections: unwanted thoughts, vivid images, nightmares. People may have similar emotional and physical reactions to trauma. Some people will develop PTSD and some will not. For example, millions of people saw the World Trade Center collapse on TV. There were some gruesome images. Not all of the people who saw it on TV developed PTSD. Many people were able to talk it out and reassure themselves in a way that prevented them from developing PTSD. Others who knew people working in the building, were there at the site or had a predisposition to develop this disorder might have PTSD today.

PTSD sufferers often experience intrusive dreams, flashbacks, hypersensitivity to similar situations (like the person who has experienced gunfire or explosions will hit the deck when a car backfires), irritability, withdrawal from others, and persistent feelings that life will not move forward.

Patients with PTSD can benefit from carefully designed and executed exposure exercises, as well as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, both of which are offered at our practice.
