In the past, our clinical interviews have helped clients in cases involving:
<ul>
    <li>Extreme Hardship evaluations: Documenting the practical, financial and emotional consequences of family separation and its psychological consequences and nature of the hardship to the petitioner.</li>
    <li>Forgiveness evaluations: Documenting the practical, financial and emotional consequences of the family members continued absence from the United States due to being barred from reentry.</li>
    <li>Asylum cases: Documenting the psychological impact of past persecution and/or fear of future persecution if the petitioner is returned to their country of origin.</li>
    <li>Spousal/partner abuse and violence (VAWA) cases: Documenting the psychological impact of the abuse suffered whether it is abuse of a physical, sexual, emotional or financial nature.</li>
    <li>For U-Visa cases: Establishing the impact of the violent crime the petitioner was exposed to and the effect it has had on them.</li>
</ul>  


We can only do evaluations of petitioners who are:
<ul>
    <li>Located in Massachusetts at the time of the video intervie.</li>
    <li>Are age 12 or over with the consent of their parent.</li>

We offer to testify to our reports, but there is an additional fee to stand by for telephonic  testimony, or to physically appear in court for your case.

We work closely with you and your client.
